# CROPWD (cropped pwd)

A small utility which returns an abbreviated form of the current directory's path.

Used in my PS1 prompt, written out of boredom. Not very serious software.

## TODO

* Write some tests
* Write documentation
* Maybe extend the functionality a bit (don't abbreviate last n directories, etc.)
